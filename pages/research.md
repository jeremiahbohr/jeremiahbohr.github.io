#### Bohr, Jeremiah and Riley E. Dunlap. 2018. "Key topics in environmental sociology, 1990–2014: Results from a computational text analysis."  *Environmental Sociology.*
*Abstract: Environmental sociology is a growing field producing a diverse body of literature while also moving into the mainstream of the larger discipline. The twin goals of this paper are to introduce environmental sociologists to innovations in content analysis, specifically a form of text-mining known as topic modeling, and then employing it to identify key themes and trends within our diverse field. We apply the topic modeling approach to a corpus of research articles within environmental sociology, identifying 25 central topics within the field and examining their prevalence over time, co-occurrence, impact (judged by citations), and prestige (judged by journal rankings). Our results indicate which topics are most prevalent, tend to occur together, and how both vary over time. They also indicate that the highest impact topics are not the most prevalent, the most prestigious topics are not the most prevalent, and topics can be prestigious without exerting much impact. We conclude with a discussion of the capabilities computational text analysis methods offer environmental sociologists.*

#### Bohr, Jeremiah. 2017. "Is it hot in here or is it just me? Temperature anomalies and political polarization over global warming in the American public."  *Climatic Change.*
*Abstract: Do temperature anomalies affect political polarization over global warming? Americans’ attitudes about global warming are affected by whether they reside in states experiencing unseasonably warm (or cold) temperatures versus those experiencing milder temperatures. Specifically, in terms of causal attribution, political polarization over global warming is more pronounced in states experiencing temperature anomalies. Using pooled data collected during 2013–2014, this study utilizes logistic regression to explore how temperature anomalies exacerbate the political polarization among Americans over perceptions of whether global warming impacts are immediately evident as well as the attribution of global warming to human activity. Results indicate that very cold or warm temperature anomalies from a 5-year baseline predict perceptions of global warming impacts and exacerbate existing political polarization over the causal attribution of global warming. These effects are particularly noticeable among Democrats. This analysis provides a contribution to understanding how temperature anomalies from the recent past shape the sociophysical context of global warming attitudes.*

#### Bohr, Jeremiah. 2016. "The ‘climatism’ cartel: why climate change deniers oppose market-based mitigation policy."  *Environmental Politics.*
*Abstract: Mainstream policy responses seek to utilize market mechanisms in an effort to
minimize costs for major emitters of greenhouse gases. Presumably, this
should win over some climate change deniers who align themselves with
think tanks promoting free markets and economic growth. Yet, climate change
deniers and free-market activists are as staunchly opposed to market-based
climate policy as they are to any other form of climate mitigation. In order to
understand why climate change deniers reject market-based policy proposals,
an archive of free-market environmental newsletters was analyzed for themes
of economic opposition. This analysis revealed how climate change deniers
rely upon the concept of a regulatory cartel to connect economic opposition
to climate policy with attacks on scientific evidence. Because professional
scientists do not operate under conventional private-market incentive structures,
neoliberal climate change deniers frame scientific knowledge as an
attack on economic freedom when utilized to guide policy governing environment–
economy relationships.*

#### Bohr, Jeremiah. 2014. "Public views on the dangers and importance of climate change: predicting climate change beliefs in the United States through income moderated by party identification." *Climatic Change.*
*Abstract: Previous research has identified the interaction between political orientation and education as an important predictor of climate change beliefs. Using data from the 2010
General Social Survey, this article looks at the moderating effect of party identification on income in predicting climate change beliefs in the U.S. Probing this interaction reveals that increased income predicts a higher probability of dismissing climate dangers among Republican-leaning individuals when compared with Independents and Democrats. Alternatively, increased income predicts a higher probability of ranking climate change as the most important environmental problem facing the United States among Democraticleaning
individuals compared with Republicans. The results indicate that income only predicts climate change beliefs in the presence of certain political orientations, with poorer Republicans
less likely to dismiss climate change dangers than their affluent counterparts.*

#### Bohr, Jeremiah. 2014. "Barriers to Environmental Sacrifice: The Interaction of Free Rider Fears with Education, Income, and Ideology." *Sociological Spectrum.*
*Abstract: Sacrificing individual material interests for collective benefits involves trust that others will act in good faith. Inherent to situations concerning collective goods is the problem of the free rider that plagues collective action: the individual who maximizes their short-term interests at the cost of the greater good. Prior research in environmental sociology has identified various social structural factors predicting pro-environmental behavior and concern, while research on social dilemmas has explored the role of trust in determining cooperation in situations regarding collective goods. This research draws upon these areas of scholarship to examine the interaction between free rider fears with education, income, and ideology in determining the willingness of Americans to sacrifice individual interest for environmental protection through an analysis of 2010 General Social Survey data. Findings help differentiate the engagement of pro-environmental behavior from general environmental concern, with the fear of free riders particularly impacting the highly educated and ideological liberals.*
